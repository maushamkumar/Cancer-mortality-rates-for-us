{"name":"nrippner_ols-regression-challenge","title":"OLS Regression Challenge","description":"Predict cancer mortality rates for US counties.\n\n# Multiple Linear Regression Challenge\n\n### **Background**\n\nThese data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. Most of the data preparation process can be veiwed [here](https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-trials).\n\n### **Your Task: Build a multivariate Ordinary Least Squares regression model to predict *\"TARGET_deathRate\"***\n\n##### **Deliverables**\n\na. Your final model equation\n\nb. The statistical software output including (adjusted) R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n\nc. Your code file (if you used a programming language)\n\nd. Model diagnostics including statistics and visualizations:\n\n    - Assess linearity of model (parameters)\n    - Assess serial independence of errors\n    - Assess heteroskedasticity\n    - Assess normality of residual distribution\n    - Assess multicollinearity\n    \ne. Your interpretation of the model\n\nf. Other factors to consider:\n\n    - Are there any outliers?\n    - Are there missing values?\n    - How will you handle categorical variables?\n\n****\n## **Good Luck and Have Fun!**\n****\n \n\n### **Data Dictionary**\n\n**TARGET_deathRate:** Dependent variable.
